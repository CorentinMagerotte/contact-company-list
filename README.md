# Hello Vertuoza !
I present you the project I created for the mixed-list exercise.

It has 2 views, a “list” view where I let my imagination run free to list the two lists in one, using the `Tailwind`, `Shadcn`  and `Headless-UI` libraries.

And a “grid” view where I used the `AG-Grid` library.

Have a nice day !

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, run the apollo server:

```bash
cd /app
node ./server.js
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
